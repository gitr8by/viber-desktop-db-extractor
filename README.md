Viber desktop contact extractor


I made this small desktop app when I lost my phone and I hadn't saved my contacts elsewhere. I had a copy of all my contacts in the viber.db app for desktop. The application reads the data from the Sqlite vibers db and it presents it in a table. tried also to make an extract function so that I could extract it in vcf or excel format.
